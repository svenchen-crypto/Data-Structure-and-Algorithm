    "**Definition**: Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and an algorithmic paradigm. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics. Like divide and conquer, it's an algorithm design technique/framework. \n",
