    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between two tasks with the same label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\",\"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `8`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: A possible sequence is: `A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.`\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing task `A`, you must wait two intervals before doing `A` again. The same applies to task `B`. In the 3rd interval, neither `A` nor `B` can be done, so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do `A` again as 2 intervals have passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `tasks = [\"A\",\"C\",\"A\",\"B\",\"D\",\"B\"], n = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `6`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: A possible sequence is: `A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `tasks = [\"A\",\"A\",\"A\", \"B\",\"B\",\"B\"], n = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `10`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: A possible sequence is: `A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.\n",
