    "Proof: Regard $G$ as a component dag called $G'$. Then component $C_i$ must have a finish time $f(C_1=i)$, where $f(C_i)$ is the largest finish time of $C_i$. Likewise, $C_j$ has $f(C_j)$ as its finish time. Assume there is an edge $(u, v)$ starts $C_i$ to $C_2$, then $f(C_i) > f(C_j)$. By definition of SCC, $G'$ is also the component dag of $G^T$ but with edges reversed. The second pass of DFS starts from connected component with largest finish time, let's use $C_i$ again. For $C_i$ to have the largest finish time, it must have **no edge comming in**, meaning that there is no edge coming out in $G^T$. By property of DFS, trees generated in the second pass of DFS with source node inside $C_i$ will only include nodes within $C_i$. And that is one SCC we want. Same applies to other components. Therefore, the claim is correct. \n",
