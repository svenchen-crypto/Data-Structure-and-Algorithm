    "# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)\n",

    "### Cut Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $(S, V – S)$ be a nontrivial cut in G (i.e. $S ≠ Ø$ and $S ≠ V$). If $(u, v)$ is the lowest-cost edge crossing $(S, V – S)$, then $(u, v)$ is in every MST of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Assume the contrary, $(u, v)$ is the lowest-cost edge crossing $(S, V – S)$, and $(u, v)$ is **NOT** in $T$ but in $T'$, where both $T, T'$ are MST. Let $w$ denotes the weight/cost of edge, then total weight of $T$ and $T'$ are $w(T) = w(S)+w(V-S)+w_1, w(S)+w(V-S)+w_2$ respectively, where $w_1, w_2$ is the weight of edges connecting $u, v$ in $T, T'$.  If $w_1<w_2$, $T$ will not be the MST (similar for $w_1>w_2$). If $w_1=w_2$, then $T$ and $T'$ are identical. Both violates our assumption, therefore, the cut property holds. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: Let $G$ be a connected, weighted graph. If all edge weights in $G$ are distinct, $G$ has exactly one MST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Assume there are 2 MST, $T_1, T_2$ in $G$, then we know that $w(T_1) = w(T_2)$, where $w$ denotes the total weight/cost. Also, there must exists an edge x such that it presents in $T_1$ but not in $T_2$. By cur property, we can partition $T_1$ to two sub-trees connected by $x$, called $t_1$ and $t_2$. If we add $x$ to $T_2$, a cycle will arise and this violets the assumption that $T_2$ is a tree. So there also must be an edge $y$ in $T_2$ in this cycle that doesn’t belong to $T_1$, and it connects $t_1$ and $t_2$ since $t_1$,$t_2$ have to be connected. By statement, cost of each edge in $G$ is distinct. So if $x$ costs more, we can remove $x$ from $T_1$ and replace it with $y$ to make a new tree with smaller weight, this contradicts our assumption that $T_1$ is a MST of $G$. (similar when $y$ costs more). Therefore, the MST in $G$ must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: If $(x, y)$ is an edge in $G$ and is the heaviest edge on some cycle $C$, then $(x, y)$ does not belong to any MST of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Suppose $(x, y)$ belong to the MST of $G$ and $(x,y)$ is the heaviest edge in an arbitrary cycle, then notice that we can always find an edge in the same cycle with lower weight connecting vertex $x$ and $y$. This violates the definition of MST. Hence, the theorem always hold. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Optimal substructure**: Prim's algorithm will find MST of subgraph $G(V_i, E_j)$, where $0 <= i <= |V|, 0 <=j <= |E|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem**: If $G$ is a connected, weighted graph, Prim's algorithm correctly finds an MST in $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: \n",
    "Claim: Prim's algorithm computes MST of subgraph with $n-1$ nodes correctly by the start of processing subgraph with $n$ nodes. \n",
    "Let $S(n)$ denotes the given statement; $T$ denotes the current MST, we will show this via inductive hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Base case) At the beginning of the prim's algorithm, $T$ is empty and it's a MST. Thus, the base holds. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Inductive) Now assume $S(k-1)$, we need to show $S(k)$ is true as well. Before the new iteration of the wile loop, $T$ is the MST of subgraph of $G$ with $k-1$ nodes. When re-enter the loop, Prim's algorithm will extract a new node $v$, there will be 2 cases: first one is when edge weight is less than the current one; the second one is when edge weight is greater than or equal to the current weight. If first case, we remove the edge that contains $v$ from $T$ and replace with the 'lighter' one. If second, we ignore it and continue. $T$ is now the MST of subgraph with $k$ nodes. This shows that $S(k-1)$ -> $S(k)$. Therefore, by inductive hypothesis, if $G$ is a connected, weighted graph, Prim's algorithm correctly finds an MST in $G$. \n",

Therefore, classic Prim's algorithm takes runtime of $|V|*O(|V|)+|E|*O(1) = O(|V^2|)$. However, in the code above, I optimized with a priority queue, which reduce the run-time to $O(|E|log|V|)$. "

    "(Base case)When $n=0$, the most recent visited node is source node itself. We have set the distance of source node to itself to 0 in the algorithm. Hence, $S(0)$ holds. \n",
    "(Inductive) Assume $S(n-1)$, and let $V_n$ denotes the laste vertex in $G$. When set the distance to be $dist[V]$, we must prove that this distance is optimal. If this is not optimal then there must be some other path to the vertex $V_N$ that is of shorter length. Suppose this some other path goes through some vertex $X$. Now, since $dist[V_n] <= dist[V_i]$, for $0<=i<=|V|$. Therefore any other path to $V_n$ will be at least $dist[V_n]$ length, unless the graph has negative edge lengths. But we know all edges are nonnegative, thus $dist[V_n]$ is the shortest distance from $V_{n-1}$ to $V_n$. Therefore, by princial of mathematical induction, Dijkstra's algorithm finds SSSP in graphs with nonnegative edge weights.\n",

    "### Bellman-Ford algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm works well on graph with nonnegative edges. But there are many cases when negative values are involved in real life. Bellman-Ford algorithm applies to general cases like this. Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm. It was first proposed by Alfonso Shimbel (1955), but is instead named after Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr since they are the people who actually published it. It can discover shortest path from source node to target node with negative edges in the graph, and detect whether a negative cycle exists in graph(there is no shortest path in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the 3 steps when designing the dynamic programming approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the meaning of list/array $dp$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $dp$ will store shortest distance from source node to each node in the graph. \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Relaxation process is exactly the recurrence relation we are looking for. The question here is why Dijkstra’s algorithm fails when there are negative edges. Consider a graph $G$ with negative edges, suppose there exists a path from $s$ to $v$ then back to $s$. If we apply Dijkstra's algorithm from $s$, when proceeding with $v$, we will discover a path with sum of weights less than 0 from $s$ to itself but can't update it due to $s$ has been processed(ie there is no 'looking back' in Dijkstra's algorithm). More formally, in Dijkstra's algorithm, if we have a vertex in open such that its cost is minimal - by adding any positive number to any vertex - the minimality will never change. Without the constraint on positive numbers - the above assumption is not true. But in Bellman-Ford algorithm, we have $dp$ to look back, so we can apply relaxation safely. \n",
