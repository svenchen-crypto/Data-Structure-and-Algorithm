    "## 721. Accounts Merge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of accounts where each element `accounts[i]` is a list of strings, where the first element `accounts[i][0]` is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: accounts = `[[\"John\",\"johnsmith@mail.com\",\"john_newyork@mail.com\"],[\"John\",\"johnsmith@mail.com\",\"john00@mail.com\"],[\"Mary\",\"mary@mail.com\"],[\"John\",\"johnnybravo@mail.com\"]]\n",
    "Output: [[\"John\",\"john00@mail.com\",\"john_newyork@mail.com\",\"johnsmith@mail.com\"],[\"Mary\",\"mary@mail.com\"],[\"John\",\"johnnybravo@mail.com\"]]\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email `johnsmith@mail.com`.\n",
    "The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.\n",
    "We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer `[['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], \n",
    "['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']]` would still be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution (Find connected components )\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we are asked to group emails in the given lists by their owners. If we take each email as a vertex, then this problem quickly becomes finding connected componnets in an undirected graph. But first, let's take a look on how to find connected components. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to find connected components in a graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, **connected component**, a set of vertices in an undirected graph that are linked to each other by paths. In order for a subgraph $S$, to be 'connected', there must be paths from vertex $u$ to another vertex $v$, where both $u, v$ are arbitrary vertices in $S$. That being said, we can visit entire connected component by traversing any vertex of it. In other words, we can can get one component by continously adding node that are reachable from our source node. Does this sound familiar? Yes, **DFS**. To see exactly how it worked, see the following implementation"

    "Back to the problem, now the solution should look very trivial. But there still one thing left: how to construct the graph we desire from the input array. First, we observe the structure of the array, we can find that it's alwaays the name of owner then followed by series of emails that belong to him/her. As mentioned previously, emails are vertices in the graph. So here comes the strategy: first we intilize an dict of list called `g`(hashmap in other languages), then for each `email` in `accounts[i][1:]`, we add `email` to `g[accounts[i][1]` and `accounts[i][1]` to `g[email]`. Meanwhile, we maintain a dictionary `names` to keep track of the owners of emails, which is important for the merge operation at the end of the algorithm. For example, `g` will look like this with the example provided:\n",

Assume in average case, each component has size of $k$, then sorting one would take $O(klogk)$, and there are $n$ accounts in total. In the worst case, all emails would belong one person, which turns the length of component to $nk$. Put them all together, we have $T(n) = m+k+nk*lognk = O(nklognk)$. \n",
