    "# Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-pointer technique is a fundamental algorithmic approach used to solve real-world problems. Unlike strategy such as “sliding window,” which follow a specific pattern, or data structures like binary trees or graphs, two pointers is not a rigid “recipe.” Instead, it is a flexible strategy that involves using two (or more) pointers to traverse one or more iterable structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, or strings) while maintaining a **“certain structure”** to solve the problem. Identifying this “structure” is crucial for the success of the two-pointer approach. However, since the two-pointer technique is not a predefined recipe, such a structure may not always exist. In this notebook, we will explore both scenarios. Before diving in, it’s worth noting that there are multiple variations of the two-pointer technique:\n",
