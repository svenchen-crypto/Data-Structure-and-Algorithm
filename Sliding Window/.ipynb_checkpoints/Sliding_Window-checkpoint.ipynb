    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a \n",
    "subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]`\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by finding the monotonicity of this problem. Note that the input array is constrained to contain positive integers. This constraint provides the monotonicity we need for the sliding window approach. When we add positive numbers, the cumulative sum can only increase, ensuring the monotonicity required for this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to iterate through the array. As we move right, we add `nums[right]` to the cumulative sum until it becomes greater than or equal to `target`. Once the cumulative sum meets or exceeds the target, we shrink the window size by incrementing `left` until the cumulative sum is less than `target`.\n",

    "###  No.3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Solution \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous question, we begin by identifying the monotonicity in the problem. By intuition, the monotonicity is \"**substring without repeating characters**\". Here, we aim to find the longest substring without any duplicates. To achieve this, we need to track the number of occurrences of each character encountered. A hashmap (or dictionary) is ideal for this purpose.\n",

    "For each new character, we add it to the hashmap. If the character has already been encountered, we increment its corresponding occurrence count. The monotonicity here is defined by the condition that no character can have an occurrence count greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the approach: as long as no key in the hashmap has a value greater than 1, we expand the window by incrementing `right`. If duplicates are found, we shrink the window by incrementing `left` until all duplicates are removed. During this process, whenever there are no duplicates, we update our result to the current window size. \n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The monotonicity in this problem is straightforward: if the substring `s[i:j]` contains all characters in `t`, it is a potential candidate. While we can find such a substring using similar logic to previous problems, we cannot guarantee that the candidate is optimal. For instance, consider `s = \"ssabsccsbcctbatz\"` and `t = \"bcbca\"`. The minimum window substring is `bcctba`, but there are other substrings in `s` that also contain all characters in `t`, such as `ssabsccsb` and `absccsb`. The challenge lies in minimizing the size of such a candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that `absccsb` is a smaller substring contained within `ssabsccsb`. Here is where monotonicity plays a role: by incrementing the left boundary continuously while `s[left]` is not part of `t`, we can ensure the substring containing all characters of `t` is of minimum size. While the concept sounds simple, implementing it is a bit more involved. Similar to the previous problem, we can use a hashmap to track the occurrences of each character in t, but additional steps are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this intuitively, imagine `s` as the transaction records of your debit card and `t` as the transaction records of your credit card. Characters present in both represent “payments” toward your credit card debt. To pay off all debts with the fewest payments, you must ensure your “debt” is always zero while shrinking the window (incrementing the left boundary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t**Initialize a hashmap `cn`** to track the occurrences of each letter in `t` and set `debt` to the length of `t`. This represents the total “debt” to be paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Iterate through `s`**: For each character, check if it is a “debt” that needs payment. If so, decrement its value in cnt and reduce debt by 1. Otherwise, simply decrement its count in cnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\t**Shrink the window**: While debt equals 0, increment the left boundary to minimize the window size and update the result accordingly.\n",

    "## No. 992. Subarrays with K Different Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array nums and an integer `k`, return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **good array** is an array where the number of different integers in that array is exactly `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `[1,2,3,1,2]` has `3` different integers: `1, 2`, and `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `nums = [1,2,1,2,3], k = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `7`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly `2` different integers: `[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,1,2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `nums = [1,2,1,3,4], k = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly `3` different integers: `[1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The question asks us to find the number of “good subarrays” within the input array. A subarray is considered “good” if it contains exactly k different integers. The monotonicity in this problem is defined as follows: a subarray `nums[i:j]` must contain exactly `k` distinct integers. Upon closer inspection, this problem is quite similar to the classic Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, meaning we can adapt its sliding window approach with minor modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we use a sliding window technique with a hashtable (or frequency map) to keep track of the count of distinct integers in the current window. Starting with both left and right pointers, we incrementally expand the right boundary of the window. Whenever the number of distinct integers in the window exceeds `k`, we shrink the window by moving the left pointer until the count of distinct integers becomes valid again.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this straightforward sliding window approach only gives us the count of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers. To find subarrays with exactly k distinct integers, we leverage the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$S(n = k) = S(n \\leq k) - S(n \\leq k - 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,  $S(n \\leq k)$  denotes the count of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers. Using this formula, we first compute the number of subarrays with at most k distinct integers and then subtract the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` distinct integers to isolate the count of “good subarrays.”"
